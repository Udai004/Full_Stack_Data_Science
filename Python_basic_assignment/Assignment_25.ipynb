    "1)\tWhat is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Square brackets are lists while parentheses are tuples. A comma must be included in a tuple even if it contains only a single value. e.g. (1,) instead of (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tWhat is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: An iterator in Python serves as a holder for objects so that they can be iterated over; a generator facilitates the creation of a custom iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tWhat are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A generator is a special type of function which does not return a single value, instead, it returns an iterator object with a sequence of values. In a generator function, a yield statement is used rather than a return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)\tWhat is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Yield is a keyword in Python that is used to return from a function without destroying the states of its local variable and when the function is called, the execution starts from the last yield statement. Any function that contains a yield keyword is termed as generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)\tWhat is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list. Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function (as no lambda is required).\n",

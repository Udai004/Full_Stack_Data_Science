    "### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. Expressions need to be evaluated. If you ask Python to print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.\n",
    "string is an expression. An expression is anything that has \"a value\". Like 3, 'Hello world', 1+1, math.sqrt(9), etc. Function names are expressions too.\n",
    "eval() gives you the value of the expression that you give to it as a string. If you say eval('1+1') it returns 2. So it returns the same that would be returned if you simply write: 1+1.\n",

    "•\tSpam = 10 --> here we are assigning 10 to a variable spam. This is referred as statement too. Statements are like instructions for python interpreter that can perform certain execution. Other types of statements are for , if , while etc. \n",

    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer: 22\n",
    "\n",
    "Because here bacon is having value 22 which is considered as int datatype. So indirectly we are refereeing to the value 22 which is stored in bacon which displays result as 23(bacon =22 --> bacon+1 => 22+1 --> 23 but bacon has 22 stored in that variable).\n",

    "###  Question 8. Why is it that eggs is a true variable name but 100 is not?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Eggs--> started with a alphabet\n",
    "\n",
    "100 --> which is a number\n",
    "\n",
    " According to rules of python , a variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character. A variable name cannot start with a number. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\n",

    "###  Question 9. Which of the following three functions may be used to convert a value to an integer, a\n",
    "### floating-point number, or a string?\n",
    "\n",

    "### Answer: Incomplete question but trying to provide possible scenarios.\n",
    "As per my assumption, we are trying to discuss about type forecasting i.e., to convert from one data type to other data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax to convert into int datatype --> int() --> ex: int(9.5) --> which gives output as 9 as it doesn’t consider float value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax to convert into float datatype --> float() --> ex: float(9) --> which gives output as 9.0 as it adds .0 to the int value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax to convert into string datatype --> str() --> ex: str(9.0) --> which gives output as ‘9.0’ as we know that string can be represented in single/double quotes.\n",

    "\n",
    "‘I have eaten‘+ 99 + ‘  burritos. ‘\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "It throws a Type Error which says tries to concatenate only strings and not int. Here 99 is int data type and rest other sentence is in string format. So to concatenate 99 with rest other sentence we need to convert 99 int value to string value as shown : ‘99’ (99 should be in single/double quotes so that python interpreter consider it as string instead of int).\n"
